                <h3 class="mt-4">Progressive Overload</h3>
                <pre>
To effectively bulk, aim to increase the weight you're lifting or the reps you're performing over time.
Gradually add weight every 1–2 weeks, even if it's just a small amount.
        </pre>

                <h3 class="mt-4">Nutrition for Bulking</h3>
                <pre>
Calorie Surplus: Eat more calories than you burn. Aim for about a 300–500 calorie surplus.

Protein: 1.6–2.2 grams per kilogram of body weight daily.

Carbs and Fats:
- Carbs: 3–6 grams per kg of body weight per day
- Fats: 0.8–1.2 grams per kg of body weight per day

Example Bulking Meal Plan:
- Breakfast: Oats with protein powder, nuts, and berries
- Lunch: Chicken breast, brown rice, and veggies
- Dinner: Salmon or steak, sweet potatoes, and a salad
- Snacks: Greek yogurt, protein shakes, and almonds
        </pre>

                <h3 class="mt-4">Rest and Recovery</h3>
                <pre>
Sleep: 7–9 hours per night to support muscle recovery and growth.

Rest: Take 1–2 days off per week or do active recovery (light cardio, stretching).
        </pre>

                <h3 class="mt-4">Supplementation (Optional)</h3>
                <pre>
- Whey Protein: Helps meet daily protein needs.
- Creatine: Supports strength and muscle mass.
- BCAAs: For recovery (optional if protein intake is adequate).
- Multivitamins: Ensures micronutrient coverage.
