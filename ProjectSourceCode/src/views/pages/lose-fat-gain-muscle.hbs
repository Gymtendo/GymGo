1. Full-Body Strength Training (3-4 Days per Week)
Strength training helps build muscle, and muscle mass increases your metabolism, which aids fat loss.

Workout Split (3 Days Example):
Day 1: Upper Body (Push & Pull)
Day 2: Lower Body & Core
Day 3: Full Body

Upper Body (Push & Pull)
- Bench Press (or Dumbbell Press) – 4 sets of 8–12 reps
- Pull-Ups (or Lat Pulldowns) – 4 sets of 8–12 reps
- Shoulder Press (Dumbbell or Barbell) – 3 sets of 10–12 reps

2. Cardio (3-4 Days per Week)
Cardio helps with fat loss and improves heart health.

HIIT (High-Intensity Interval Training):
- 30 seconds of high-intensity sprinting on a treadmill, followed by 1 minute of walking. Repeat for 20–30 minutes.

Steady-State Cardio:
- 30–45 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise (cycling, running, rowing, etc.) at 60-70% of your maximum heart rate.

3. Nutrition
- Protein: Aim for 1.2–2 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight daily to support muscle growth and recovery.
- Calorie Deficit: A small deficit (10–20% fewer calories than maintenance) promotes fat loss without sacrificing muscle mass.
- Healthy Fats and Carbs: Include healthy fats (avocados, nuts, olive oil) and complex carbs (sweet potatoes, whole grains, vegetables) for energy and muscle recovery.

4. Recovery
- Aim for at least 7–8 hours of sleep per night.
- Incorporate rest days to allow your muscles to recover and grow.

Bonus Tips:
- Focus on progressive overload (gradually increasing weight or reps over time).
- Track your progress to see improvements and adjust accordingly.
