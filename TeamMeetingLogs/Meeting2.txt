We are planning out the nav bar and the handle bars, we're drawing out a UI to implement
Nav bar will be on the header, when opened on mobile it'll be on the footer
We all finished user stories
next week: have running code from the stories
We have a small feature assigned to each person:
    Issac - 2 units tests and friends 
    Emily - Login logout, nav bar fine tuning, personal goals 
    Ethan - leaderboard + database
    Emma - exercise history add/drop 
    Kevin - Objectives (quests/boss) + database
